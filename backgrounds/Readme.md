# Background noise

This directory contains sample images of background noise. We used two Kaggle datasets 
([real-world-documents-collections](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaz13/real-world-documents-collections) and
[didadataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ayavariabdi/didadataset)) to extract the document background noise of all
images.
